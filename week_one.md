# Week 1: Foundations of Prompt Engineering

## Week Overview
Welcome to Week 1 of our 8-week prompt engineering series! This informational resource introduces the essentials of prompt engineering, a critical skill in 2025 as large language models (LLMs) and multimodal AI systems power applications from research to business to creative arts. You’ll learn what prompt engineering is, why it matters, and how to craft effective prompts using structured frameworks and an understanding of LLM mechanics. Designed for graduate students with no prior knowledge, this week combines clear explanations, relatable examples, and optional activities to build a strong foundation for the series.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this week, you should be able to:
- Define prompt engineering and explain its role in AI systems and human-AI collaboration<a href="#ref-2">[2]</a>.
- Identify the core components of an effective prompt (e.g., task, context, constraints)<a href="#ref-1">[1]</a>.
- Apply the RACE framework to design structured prompts<a href="#ref-2">[2]</a>.
- Describe how LLMs process prompts, including the role of parameters like temperature and top-p<a href="#ref-6">[6]</a>.
- Recognize common prompt patterns (e.g., question-answering, instructional)<a href="#ref-1">[1]</a>.

## What is Prompt Engineering?
Prompt engineering is the art and science of designing input queries or instructions to elicit accurate, relevant, and useful responses from AI models, particularly LLMs<a href="#ref-2">[2]</a>. Think of it like giving clear directions to a talented but literal-minded assistant: the better your instructions, the better the results. In 2025, prompt engineering is vital as LLMs drive chatbots, code generation, and even multimodal tasks (e.g., combining text and images). Well-crafted prompts reduce errors, enhance reliability, and align AI outputs with user goals, making it a key skill across industries<a href="#ref-2">[2]</a>.

## Anatomy of a Prompt
Effective prompts consist of key elements that guide the LLM<a href="#ref-1">[1]</a>:
- **Task Definition**: Clearly state the goal (e.g., “Summarize this article”).
- **Context**: Provide background (e.g., “for a beginner audience”).
- **Instructions**: Specify style or approach (e.g., “use bullet points”).
- **Constraints**: Set boundaries (e.g., “in 100 words or less”).
- **Formatting**: Define output structure (e.g., “in JSON format”).
For example: “As a chef, suggest a vegetarian recipe for beginners in under 150 words, formatted as a list.” Combining these elements reduces ambiguity and ensures outputs meet expectations<a href="#ref-1">[1]</a>.

## The RACE Framework
The RACE framework (Role, Action, Context, Expectation) is a modern, streamlined approach to prompt design, widely used in 2025<a href="#ref-2">[2]</a>:
- **Role**: Assign a persona (e.g., “Act as a science teacher”).
- **Action**: Specify the task (e.g., “Explain photosynthesis”).
- **Context**: Add relevant details (e.g., “for high school students”).
- **Expectation**: Clarify output (e.g., “in 3 bullet points”).
Example: “As a historian, summarize the causes of World War I for college students in a 200-word paragraph.” RACE ensures clarity and specificity, building on earlier frameworks like CLEAR by emphasizing role-playing for better LLM performance<a href="#ref-2">[2]</a>.

## How Large Language Models Process Prompts
LLMs break prompts into tokens (e.g., words or characters) and use neural networks to predict responses based on patterns in their training data<a href="#ref-6">[6]</a>. Two key parameters influence outputs:
- **Temperature**: Controls randomness, like adjusting creativity in a brainstorming session. Low temperature (e.g., 0.2) gives predictable responses; high temperature (e.g., 1.0) adds variety.
- **Top-p (Nucleus Sampling)**: Limits predictions to the most likely tokens, ensuring coherence.
Understanding these helps you balance precision and creativity, especially for tasks like writing or problem-solving<a href="#ref-6">[6]</a>.

## Common Prompt Patterns
Prompts follow established patterns to suit different tasks<a href="#ref-1">[1]</a>:
- **Question-Answering**: Direct queries (e.g., “What is gravity? Answer in one sentence.”).
- **Instructional**: Command-based (e.g., “Analyze this dataset and list key trends.”).
- **Creative Writing**: Open-ended (e.g., “Write a short story about a future AI city.”).
- **Chain-of-Thought**: Encourages reasoning (e.g., “Solve this math problem step-by-step.”).
Choosing the right pattern enhances output quality, a skill you’ll refine throughout this series<a href="#ref-1">[1]</a>.

## Suggested (Optional) Activities
- Analyze a strong prompt (e.g., “As a biologist, explain DNA replication in 3 sentences for beginners”) vs. a weak one (e.g., “Tell me about DNA”). Test both using your AI of choice and note differences in clarity or accuracy<a href="#ref-1">[1]</a>.
- Craft a prompt using the RACE framework for a personal task (e.g., “As a travel guide, recommend 3 budget-friendly destinations in Europe for students, listing pros and cons in bullet points”). Tweak one element (e.g., context) and compare outputs<a href="#ref-3">[3]</a>.
- Experiment with a creative writing prompt (e.g., “Write a 100-word story about a robot learning empathy”) and adjust the temperature (e.g., 0.2 vs. 1.0) in a tool like Grok or ChatGPT to observe changes in style<a href="#ref-6">[6]</a>.

## Reflection Questions
- How does the structure of a prompt (e.g., using RACE) impact the quality of an LLM’s response?
- What challenges did you notice when crafting or tweaking prompts, and how might clarity or context address them?
- Why do you think prompt engineering has become so important in 2025 for AI applications?
